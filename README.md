DatapathDesignMips
==================
Designed a custom RISC processor which is basically a stripped down MIPS  processor. We get more practical hands-on 
approach to computer architecture design problems. The processor we designed is a 32-bit version of the MIPS processor and
the instruction set will be a small subset of the actual MIPS ISA. We implemented the multicycle datapath version of the 
processor utilizing the VHDL hardware descriptive language. The processor must support the three types of  instruction 
formats of R, I, and J (beq), along with store word and load word.
